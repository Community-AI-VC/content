## Project is currently in planning stage

## Licensing

Data is MIT Licensed (see data/LICENSE.md)

Tools are available to use as browser extensions, http api, or web apps, but are not yet open source licensed. 

Once we have some DAO-based community funding and/or support of some investors we will switch to an MIT License.

Tools that we develop during our R&D process that end up being tangential to the project and are thus abandoned by us, will be 
open sourced under the MIT License. They will have their own separate repository under [[https](https://github.com/Community-AI-VC/)](Community-AI-VC) org.

## Tools Release:

WIP: in-browser slide-to-text convertor and feature extractor
