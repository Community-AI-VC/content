Tools are available to use as browser extensions, http api, or web apps, but are not yet open source licensed. 

Once we have some DAO-based community funding or other forms of support to sustain our work, we will open source the tools and 
continue to develop them under MIT License.

Tools that we develop during our R&D process that end up being tangential to the project and are thus abandoned by us, will be 
open sourced under the MIT License. They will have their own separate repository under [[https](https://github.com/Community-AI-VC/)](Community-AI-VC) org.
